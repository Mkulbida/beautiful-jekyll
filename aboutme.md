Hi! My name is Mike Kulbida.  I am a Social Worker overseeing the Childcare and Head Start Programs for the 
Arizona Department of Child Safety. I specialize in working with Infants and Toddlers as well as children 
with complex medical or developmental needs. My passion lies in creating and refining public programs to help 
children and families, with the eventual goal of working for UNICEF getting paid to travel the world saving babies.

Fun Facts:
- I've been to 19 countries and counting
- Camped in 32 of the 62 US National Parks
- Proud Disneyland AP holder
- Technological skills of a 97 year old
